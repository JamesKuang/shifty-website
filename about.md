Hello,

I'm James Kuang ([@jamskuang](https://twitter.com/jamskuang)) and on my free time I work on [@ShiftyCalendar](https://twitter.com/shiftycalendar). I also work at [Fieldlens](https://fieldlens.com) in NYC.

Shifty is a special calendar app for shift workers that I originally made for my girlfriend who is a Neonatal ICU nurse. She has since convinced the NICU unit at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City to use Shifty. I hope Shifty can help save you time as well.

Any questions, feature suggestions or feedback? I'd love to hear all about them, good or bad. Get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamskuang) or [email](mailto:incyc.apps@gmail.com).
