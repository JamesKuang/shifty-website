* View all your shifts! Why was the max 4? Nonsense, that was!
* In the Today extension, dots got larger, or in circle speak, more radial...
* When Exporting shifts, the new behavior will now only export today and future dates. Because your shifts are obviously only in the future...just like your sick days.
* Calendar performance improvements. It was literally completely swapped. Still looks the same tho, more or less.
* Bug fixes. Because why not?
