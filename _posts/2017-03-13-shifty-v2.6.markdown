## Shifty 2.6 is [now available](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shifty-unpredictable-work-schedules-and-events/id718617321?mt=8)!

#### What's new?
* View all your shifts! Why was the max 4? Nonsense, that was!
* In the Today extension, dots got larger, or in circle speak, more radial...
* When Exporting shifts, the new behavior will now only export today and future dates. Because your shifts are obviously only in the future...just like your sick days.
* Calendar performance improvements. It was literally completely swapped. Still looks the same tho, more or less.
* Bug fixes. Because why not?
