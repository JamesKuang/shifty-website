What's new you ask? Everything!
* The #1 most requested feature is here! You can now mark multiple shifts in Shifty. 6 to be exact!
* Templates have been replaced with Shift Groups, which are a lot more powerful. Each Shift Group can have its own export settings and a dot color (more to come!).
* View up to 3 shifts per day.
* A brand new look and app icon.
* Landscape support on iPad. You weren't holding it wrong, I was just lazy.
* Check out the new FAQs section, where you'll find cool ways to use Shifty and other tips and tricks.
